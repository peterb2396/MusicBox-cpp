Redirect root to configuration page

TODO:
BuiltByPeter endpoints:
- Link page to login and authorize
- Database modifications for the above
- Finish ESP side retrieval and request

- UploadFirmware endpoint, like upload resume
- Look into security for uploads
- Separate it from my user account if needed. Can just add a password box.

Should be able to test firmware updates, authorization and all

** Need to change createPlaylist to createOrFindPlaylist()
** brush up and test all api calls
