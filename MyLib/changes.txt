Whenever I modify a library, I note my changes here and 
copy the library to this folder.

WiFiManager:
Redirected root to configuration page. Copied route code to be the same as R_wifi
Added configClosedCallback (WiFiManager.cpp, WiFiManager.h)

5/11/24: 
- modified autoConnect function to accommodate the new feature where if connecting to the stored SSID fails (existing logic), we check a CSV list of SSID's provided by the user, and connect to the one with the best signal. Provided a removeWhitespace helper function to tokenize each CSV.

- modified HTML in handleWifi function to comment out SSID / password. Due to the above feature, the user does not enter a wifi here, instead, they enter a list of wifi networks. The latest will always be stored on the system to auto connect to that one as a priority. This network will change whenever it fails and finds a more suitable one, this is all behind the scenes, so the user does not need to modify this stored value.
